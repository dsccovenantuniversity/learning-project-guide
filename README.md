A repository containing information on how members are to approach project-based learning.

## Steps

- [x] A repo is created with a README file describing the challenge to be completed, and containing links to more info/resources

- [ ] You fork the repo, and create a new branch, named in format `firstname-lastname`

- [ ] If you're adding a new project, make a new folder also named `firstname-lastname`

- [ ] Commit your edits and PR whenever you want a review or are ready to merge

- [ ] Each PR would need two reviews to be merged

> Ensure ALL YOUR contributions ARE WITHIN YOUR FOLDER to minimise merge conflicts _(Any contributions you want to make to the repo must follow the issue-fork-branch flow used to make open-source contributions)_

## First activity - Get on the list

- Once you're done reading this, fork this repo and clone your fork

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/john/learning-project-guide.git
Cloning into '~/Downloads/learning-project-guide'...
...
Done.
```

- Create a branch named `firstname-lastname` and switch to it

```sh
$ git checkout -b john-doe
Switched to a new branch 'john-doe'
```

- And add your name to [this file](README.md) in the section below (There's no need for a folder since we're all working on the same file)

- Open a [pull request](https://github.com/dsccovenantuniversity/learning-project-guide/compare) so we can get your work merged! (don't forget to compare across forks!)

- You're now one of us, complete with your name recorded 😊😀
